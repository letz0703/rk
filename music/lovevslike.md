옷이 나를 따뜻하게 해주는 것은 열을 내서 따뜻하게 해주는 게 아니라 열을 보존해서 따뜻하게 해주는 거야
반면 음식은 체내에 열을 발생 시켜서 나를 따뜻하게 해주고 내 체온을 유지해 주지.
좋은 사람 또는 좋아하는 사람은 옷과 같은 존재 이고 사랑하는 사람은 음식과 같은 존재가 아닐까? 이제야 좋아한다와 사랑한다의 차이를 알게 된 것 같아. 사람을 병들게 하는건 몸에서 발생하는 체온을 조절 하지 못해서래. 그래서 사랑을 하면 병이 나는 건가봐...

Like Vs. Love

Like Vs. Love (최종 개선 버전)
(Verse 1)
The coat that wraps around me tight,
Doesn't generate a warming light.
It merely holds the heat I make,
For comfort, for my body's sake.
A gentle shield against the cold,
A story quietly unfolds.

(Chorus 1)
Is "like" a garment, soft and near,
Preserving warmth, dispelling fear.
But "love," a flame within my core,
Ignites and burns, and asks for more.
It fuels the furnace deep inside,
Where life's own fever starts to ride.

(Verse 2)
A simple meal, a hearty bite,
Ignites a warmth, so pure and bright.
It stokes the embers, keeps me sound,
My body's core, forever bound.
A vital need, a constant plea,
To sustain the life inside of me.

(Chorus 2)
Is "like" a comfort, known and true,
Protecting gently, me and you.
But "love," a fire, wild and free,
Can burn too hot, and trouble me.
It fuels the furnace deep inside,
Where life's own fever starts to ride.

(Bridge)
We say that sickness can appear,
When body's balance disappears.
Perhaps this love, with fervent might,
Disturbs the calm, and steals the light.
A fragile dance, a heated sway,
When hearts connect and lose their way.

(Chorus 3)
Is "like" a haven, safe and mild,
Where gentle warmth is reconciled.
But "love," a wildfire in the night,
Consuming all within its light.
It fuels a passion, deep and grand,
Where even reason fails to stand.

(Outro)
The coat's soft warmth, a constant friend,
Love's burning fire, without end.
One keeps me sheltered, strong and bold,
The other's heat can take its toll.
